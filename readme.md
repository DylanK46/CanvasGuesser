## Introduction
Dylan Kainth's Computer Science Summer Project

CanvasGuesser is a pictionary game, it's basically a clone of the vastly popular [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/)

## Inner Workings
CanvasGuesser uses a Python Flask webserver, which can be found in app.py;

It uses Socket.io for websocket transmission, which you can read more about [here](https://socket.io/)

It uses Vue.js in the frontend html, allowing for real-time DOM updates, read more [here](https://vuejs.org/) (js, woohoo)
